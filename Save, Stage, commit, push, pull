First after typing in a line of stuff, soon to be code, make sure to save. there is no auto saving
Then stage the file, this will prep it for commiting WAIT you need to add a summary of what you did or you cannot commit the file.
After commiting I need to push the file. becsue if I do not the file remins on my local hardrive but teach cannot tell that I actually did anything. PUSH sends the local changes I have made to the cloud aka my GITHUB cloud
If i work on a seperate computer and I need my changes I can pull, allowing me to get the changes made from somewhere else.
